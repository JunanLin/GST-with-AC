    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <section>
      <p>This report presents a brief gate-set tomography (GST) analysis of a dataset called $(datasetLabel)s.   It is intended for folks who are already familiar with GST output tables and plots.  If this isn't you, you should have set <code>brief=False</code> when you generated this report.</p>

      <h1>Goodness-of-model Analysis</h1>
      <p>Table <a href="#progressTable" class="table"></a> shows how well GST was able to fit you data through its iterations, and <a href="#bestEstimateColorBoxPlot" class="figure"></a> displays the more detailed goodness-of-fit contributions from each individual gate sequence.</p>
      
    <figure class='tbl' id="progressTable">
      <figcaption><strong>Comparison between the computed and expected maximum $\log(\mathcal{L})$ for different values of $L$</strong>.  $N_S$ and $N_p$ are the number of gate strings and parameters, respectively.  The quantity $2\Delta\log(\mathcal{L})$ measures the goodness of fit of the GST model (small is better) and is expected to lie within $[k-\sqrt{2k},k+\sqrt{2k}]$ where $k = N_s-N_p$. $N_\sigma = (2\Delta\log(\mathcal{L})-k)/\sqrt{2k}$ is the number of standard deviations from the mean (a $p$-value can be straightforwardly derived from $N_\sigma$).  The rating from 1 to 5 stars gives a very crude indication of goodness of fit as explained in the text.</figcaption>

      <figcaption><strong>$2\Delta\log(\mathcal{L})$ contributions for every individual experiment in the dataset</strong>.   Each pixel represents a single experiment (gate sequence), and its color indicates whether GST was able to fit the corresponding frequency well.  Shades of white/gray are typical. Red squares represent statistically significant evidence for model violation (non-Markovianity), and should appear with probability at most %(linlg_pcntle)s%% if the data really are Markovian. Square blocks of pixels correspond to base sequences (arranged vertically by germ and horizontally by length); each pixel within a block corresponds to a specific choice of pre- and post-fiducial sequences.  See text for further details.</figcaption>

      <h1>Gateset Estimates</h1>
      <p>Below is a collection of GST's primary result tables, ordered in what we think is a natural way.  These tables all pertain to the best-estimate gateset, that is, the one corresponding to the final iteration of the GST algorithm.  Table <a href="#bestGatesetGaugeParamsTable" class="table"></a> lists the relevant parameters used during the gauge optimization step which resulted in the estimates that follow.</p>

      <figcaption><strong>Gauge Optimization Details</strong>.  A list of the parameters used when performing the gauge optimization that produced the final GST results found in subsequent tables and figures.</figcaption>

      <figcaption><strong>Comparison of GST estimated gates to target gates</strong>.  This table presents, for each of the gates, three different measures of distance or discrepancy from the GST estimate to the ideal target operation.  See text for more detail.  The second table lists the <q>Error Generator</q> for each gate, which is the Lindbladian $\mathbb{L}$ that describes <em>how</em> the gate is failing to match the target.  This error generator is defined by the equation %(errorgenformula)s.</figcaption>

      <figcaption><strong>Eigen-decomposition of estimated gates</strong>.  Each estimated gate is described in terms of: (1) the eigenvalues of the superoperator; (2) the gate's fixed point (as a vector in $\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H})$, in the Pauli basis); (3)  the axis around which it rotates, as a vector in $\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H})$; (4) the angle of the rotation that it applies; (5) the decay rate along the axis of rotation (<q>diagonal decay</q>); (6) the decay rate perpendicular to the axis of rotation (<q>off-diagonal decay</q>); and (7) the angle between each gate's rotation axis and the rotation axes of the other gates.  <q>X</q> indicates that the decomposition failed or couldn't be interpreted.</figcaption>

    <figure class='tbl' id="bestGatesetChoiTable">
      <figcaption><strong>Choi matrix representation of the GST estimated gate set</strong>.  This table lists Choi representations of the estimated gates, and their eigenvalues.  Unitary gates have a spectrum $(1,0,0\ldots)$, just like pure quantum states.  Negative eigenvalues are non-physical, and may represent either statistical fluctuations or violations of the CPTP model used by GST.</figcaption>
